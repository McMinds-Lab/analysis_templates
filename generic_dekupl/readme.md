this workflow requires a version of DE-kupl that has been modified. We accomplished this by:

1) installing DE-kupl via conda
2) adding https://github.com/rmcminds/dekupl-run/blob/master/bin/zeroinfl_diff_method.R and https://github.com/rmcminds/dekupl-run/blob/master/bin/binomial_diff_method.R to the dekupl bin directory in the conda environment
3) replacing the standard snakefile in the conda env with https://github.com/rmcminds/dekupl-run/blob/master/Snakefile
4) installing the package 'pscl' in the R installation included in the conda env. (e.g. conda activate dekupl; start an interactive R session; run install.packages('pscl'))
5) installing the packages 'Rmpi', 'doMPI', and 'RhpcBLASctl' (our cluster requires gcc and mpi modules to first be loaded, a variable set, and the installation to occur where mpi can be loaded eg. using srun rather than directly on the head node): module load compilers/gcc/4.8.1; module load mpi/openmpi/1.6.1; export OMPI_MCA_mtl=^psm; srun --pty R --interactive; install.packages(c('Rmpi','doMPI','RhpcBLASctl'), configure.args=list(Rmpi=c("--with-mpi=/apps/openmpi/1.6.1/","--with-Rmpi-include=/apps/openmpi/1.6.1/include","--with-Rmpi-libpath=/apps/openmpi/1.6.1/lib","--with-Rmpi-type=OPENMPI")), INSTALL_opts="--no-test-load", dependencies=TRUE, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
6) The mpi modules must also be loaded when running DE-kupl. 

These changes allow the use of a zero inflated negative binomial test, or a binary presence/absence test, by using the key diff_method: zeroinfl or diff_method: binomial

For 'zeroinfl', a gene is considered 'significant' if it's either differentially prevalent OR differentially abundant when present. the 'log2fc' value is not actually a log2-fold-change when the gene is differentially prevalent, so units are mixed up among genes and as a whole are essentially meaningless. Therefore it probably only makes sense to remove an effect size cutoff with the key log2fc_threshold:0 in the config.json. To use the method zeroinfl, the argument zi_cores is required in the config.json to pass the level of parallelization to the method.

These scripts appear to be MUCH slower than the DESeq2 option, and this is why I made the modifications to use MPI - this is the most convenient way to parallelize across more than one machine.
