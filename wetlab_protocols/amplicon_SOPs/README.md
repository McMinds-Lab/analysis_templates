#Basic Principles
Amplified DNA is a major risk for cross-contamination of unamplified DNA. Many opinion papers cover basic protocols (which I should collate here in the future), but for now:

1. it is best to set up PCRs in a positive-flow hood. Once your template DNA is diluted into a PCR mixture, it is at risk of being contaminated.
2. Thermocyclers and electrophoresis equipment should be in a separate work area or even separate room from the 'main lab'. All amplified DNA stays in that work area or room. All pipettors and other equipment for handling amplified DNA is specific to that area and is never used for work with unamplified samples
3. filter tips and extremely clean consumables (such as individually-wrapped centrifuge tubes) are highly recommended for microbiome work
4. Sterile technique is important. Simple things like reaching over tubes can lead to contamination. Set up your workstation so you and your pipettor can get to everything with a direct line that doesn't pass over other tubes.
