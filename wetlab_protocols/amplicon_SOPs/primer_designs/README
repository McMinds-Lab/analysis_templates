file 2nd_step_primers_with_Schloss_lab_indices.txt was created by concatenating the Nextera-format multiple amplicon adapter sequences to the Schloss lab indices available at https://github.com/SchlossLab/MiSeq_WetLab_SOP/blob/master/MiSeq_WetLab_SOP.md or https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/

my 2-step protocol produces illumina reads that include the linker and locus-specific primer sequence, which usually needs to be trimmed

be careful with the orientation of the reverse indices. I believe the sequence ordered from IDT is the reverse complement of the sequence observed in an Illumina read
